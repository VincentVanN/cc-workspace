# Constitution — [PROJECT_NAME]
> Configured on: [DATE]

Non-negotiable principles for this project. The orchestrator and every teammate
must follow these rules without exception.

<!-- Write YOUR engineering principles below. Number them starting at 1.
     The workspace-init agent will help you fill this interactively.

     Common categories to consider:
     - Security & data (multi-tenancy, secrets, auth)
     - UX & quality (loading states, responsive, feedback)
     - Code & architecture (dead code, tests, consistency)
     - Process (planning, QA, reviews)

     Example rules for inspiration:

     1. **Multi-tenancy is sacred.** No query may return data from one tenant
        to another. Every query, endpoint, and view is scoped by tenant.

     2. **No hardcoded secrets.** Zero passwords, API keys, or tokens in code.
        Everything goes through environment variables.

     3. **4 mandatory states.** Every component that displays data must handle:
        loading, empty, error, success. No blank screens, ever.

     4. **No feature without tests.** Every new behavior has at minimum one test
        proving it works and one test proving it handles errors.

     5. **Consistency over preference.** Follow existing patterns in the repo,
        even if you'd prefer it differently.
